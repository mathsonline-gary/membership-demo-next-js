# Session Note: README Overhaul

**Timestamp:** 2024-06-09

## Task/Question

Rewrite and modernize `README.md` to accurately reflect the project, its tech stack, features, and setup, following best practices for open-source documentation.

## Key Decisions & Solutions

- **Why:** The original README was generic and did not communicate the project's purpose, tech stack, or features, making onboarding and collaboration harder.
- **What:**
  - Audited the codebase to identify actual features (authentication, team management, chat, settings, etc.).
  - Chose a clear, modular README structure: summary, tech stack, installation, features, project structure, best practices, documentation, contributing, license.
  - Matched feature list to real implementation (e.g., included 2FA, device management; excluded unimplemented features).
  - Used concise, professional language and linked to relevant docs for further learning.
- **Learning Opportunity:** Demonstrates how to align documentation with real project capabilities and why clarity in onboarding docs is critical for maintainability and collaboration.

## Files Created/Modified/Discussed

- `README.md` — rewritten for clarity, accuracy, and professionalism
- `.cursor/notes/README-overhaul.md` — session note (this file)

## Important Context

- Project uses Next.js 15, React 19, Tailwind CSS 4, shadcn/ui, Zustand, TanStack Query, React Hook Form, Zod, pnpm.
- Follows modular, feature-based architecture and modern best practices.
- README now serves as both onboarding and technical reference for new contributors.

**Next Steps:**

- Review `README.md` for accuracy and completeness.
- Add `.env.example` if missing.
- Optionally add usage examples, API docs, or screenshots for further clarity.
